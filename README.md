# ðŸš€ Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization
This repository contains the code for the design and optimization of trajectories specifically for Mars Ascent Vehicles (MAVs), using a Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization (MOTO) framework, with detailed methodology described in [1]. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, incorporating a range of dynamic and geometric constraints. An initial Pareto front is generated using a direct weighted product scalarization approach with uniform weights. To improve resolution and better capture the trade-offs between objectives, an adaptive bi-objective weighted product method is implemented, following the refinement procedure described in [2]. Trajectory optimization and discretization are implemented using Pyomo [1], while nonlinear programs are solved using IPOPT. This repository also provides a foundation for more advanced Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) research related to planetary ascent and autonomous mission planning.

### Key Features:

Key Features:

--> Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF) Dynamics: The MAV flight is modeled using full 6-DoF equations of motion.

--> Quaternion and Euler Representations: Both are implemented. Due to numerical feasibility and constraint sensitivity, only one can be activated at a time by commenting the other out.

--> Multi-Objective Optimization: Simultaneously maximizes downrange distance and final payload mass (or equivalently minimizes fuel consumption).

--> Pareto Front Generation: Captures trade-offs between objectives using scalarization techniques.

--> Adaptive Weighted Product Method: Refines the Pareto front adaptively for better solution diversity and resolution.

--> Mars-Relevant Physics: Includes aerodynamic and propulsion models tailored for Mars ascent conditions.

### Technical Implementation:

--> Built with Pyomo, a Python-based optimization modeling framework.

--> Solved using IPOPT, a nonlinear programming solver.
