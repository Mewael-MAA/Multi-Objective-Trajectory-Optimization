# Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization of MAV
 The study frames the problem as a Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization (MOTO) challenge, subject to an optimal control approach that respects various dynamic and geometric constraints. The proposed solution is implemented using Pyomo in conjunction with Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT), a nonlinear programming solver. The algorithm incorporates, six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) flight dynamics models, as well as aerodynamic and propulsion data. The 6-DoF equations are formulated using quaternions to avoid mathematical singularities and physical issues, such as gimbal lock. The MOTO problem addresses objectives that include maximizing range while minimizing fuel consumption. A set of optimal results spread across a Pareto front is then obtained. Beyond trajectory predictions, this work provides a foundational approach for further multidisciplinary optimization research in the context of MAVs and ballistic hoppers.
